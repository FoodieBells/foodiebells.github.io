                                <p><i>Hello guys, I am <b>Tia Kapoor</b>. Thank you for stopping by and taking the time to read my "Blog". After much awaited time, huge resistance from inside with my day to day routine, versus finding time to write and maintaining the blog versus taking care of my 16 Month old versus juggling with work in a nutshell "life". I have finally gathered the courage to have one of my dreams come true of being a "BLOGGER" after being a "MOM" = "BLOGGERMOM". This is all thanks to my Husband dear of course! Love you babe to the moon and back. Thank you xx.</i></p>
                                <p><i>I am working Mother of 1 little cute, adorable boy, have a passion for FOOD! More into cooking than EATING. But one thing that differentiates me from others is that I am on the lookout for shortcuts! Please don't judge! Haha Having a little one running around and cooking under pressure is stressful! hence I am always finding ways to cook single handedly (while holding my Little one close) or being quick so we can just get over the cooking part and eat in peace (fingers crossed). Food needs to obviously please my little one so he can be fed with little effort and of course to please my darling Husband. I also love cooking for him and love it when he finds the food tasty! He gets this twinkle in the eyes which melts my heart each time.</i></p>
                                <p><i>Please go ahead and check out my website, i will slowly will be populating with quick food reciepes, some product reviews to come up, some focus on Baby food reciepes that are highly nutrious.</i></p>
                                <p><i>Any feedback is very welcomed, write to me if you have special requests or write to me regardless as I would love to hear from you. Also any encouragement is welcomed!!</i></p>
                                <p><i>Lots of Love</i></p>
